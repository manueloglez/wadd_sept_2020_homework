1. What do you think are some of the differences in designing for something that is always with you (like a mobile phone), compared to something you use in a fixed location such as a desktop computer?
  R. 
  
2. Think of an app that in your opinion has made poor choices about some tradeoffs or constraints, like the ones the author complains about in the CBS News app (breaking stories into too-small chunks, taking too long to load, and having to scroll past the same photo on each page before getting to any text)?  Describe the app and explain your experience.
  R.
  
3. Which do you use more: your phone or a desktop or laptop computer? How much overlap is there in the ways that you use them?  Do you prefer using one over the other?
  R.

4. What’s your favorite mobile app? Why?  
  R.
  
5. Have you ever purchased a mobile app that turned out to be too hard to learn?  Or too hard to use?
  R.
  
6. Do you know people who rarely talk on their phones )preferring to text or email)? How do you think mobile devices are changing how we interact with each other?
  R.
  
7. Describe an app that you find “delightful” and explain why, in the same way the author explained his examples of SoundHound and Paper.  Do not use the same app example as question 4.  Also, say whether you think the designers of the app made it both delightful and usable, or sacrificed some usability in their effort to achieve delight.
  R.
  
8. Find an app that does a good job of providing help or a tutorial or training about how to use it. Describe the app and how it works.
  R.

9. Find a friend, family member, or classmate who would be willing to do a usability test conducted by you.  You can ask more than one person, but at least one other person is needed.
  Obsertations:
    

10. Find an app that can be used in both mobile and desktop versions, and try it on at least two different screen sizes (such as smartphone, tablet, laptop, desktop).  Write up your notes on the differences among the versions and answer these questions:
  Are there significant differences in features among the versions? What differences did you notice?
    R.
  Does one version seem to work significantly better than the others? In what ways?
    R.
  How did the designers adapt to smaller screen sizes? Did they scale down the size of elements? Eliminate elements?
    R.

//////////////////// Chapter 11
1. Krug has a list of things your site can do that make a user’s goodwill plunge:
  Hiding information that I want, like phone numbers, shipping rates, and prices.
  Making me enter data in a specific format (e.g. no spaces in my credit card number)
  Asking me for information you don’t really need.
  Disingenuous attempts to convince me that you care about me. (“Your call is very important to us.”)
  Putting lots of marketing between me and the content I’m looking for.
  Looking amateurish.
Which ones annoy you the most, and why? Can you think of any others that aren’t on the list?
  R.
  
2. Pick something that really annoys you about a site or an app and try to figure out why the designers did it that way.  Do you think they had a business reason, or were they just careless or didn’t they think about what their users wanted or needed?
  R.
  
3. In this passage, Krug seems to be saying that it’s acceptable to abuse your users as long as you are making a conscious, informed business decision:

        There may be times when you’ll choose to have your site do some of these user-
        unfriendly things deliberately. Sometimes it makes business sense not to do
        exactly what the customer wants. For instance, uninvited pop-ups almost always
        annoy people to some extent. But if your statistics show you can get 10 percent
        more revenue by using pop-ups and you think it’s worth annoying your users, you
        can do it. It’s a business decision. Just be sure you do it in an informed way, rather
        than inadvertently.

Do you agree? Can you reconcile this with his advice to be a mensch?
  R.
  
4. When a site pops up a message that asks you if you would be willing to give feedback about the site, does that increase or diminish your goodwill?
  R.

5. When you open a Website on a mobile device, you are often asked if you want to download the corresponding mobile app instead.  What do you usually do when this happens?
  R.
  
6. Think of a site or app that increased your goodwill and explain what, specifically, it did to earn it. Did these positive feelings cause you to change your behaviour in any way (e.g. recommend it to a friend)?
  R.
  
7. Find or design an example of an interface that makes it easy to enter a credit card number in the correct format.  (Add this design to your homework directory in a separate file from the text file, for example: credit_card.html)
  R.
  
8. Give an example of a site or app that saves you time.
  R.
  
9. Find an example of a site that looks less than professional, and say what you would do to improve it.
  R.
  
10. Go to CodeCore’s website (https://codecore.ca), download the app, or do both.  Pick at least 3 tasks to accomplish. (For example, finding information regarding a program, or getting contact details, etc).  Chart your level of goodwill as you use the site.  Write about your experience, good or bad.  Don’t be afraid to mention  things that you may wish to improve.
  R.
